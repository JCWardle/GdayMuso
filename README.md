# hello-muso

Hello Muso is your chance to show us how you write, reason and commit code.

# Overview

This is a coding assignment. We want to see how you approach building a full stack, hello world style application, in the shortest possible time.

We will be focusing on:

* Simplicity
* Best practices
* Elegance
* Contemporary Code

# Requirements

This coding assignment is more like a puzzle than a project. Approach it the wrong way, it's going to seem daunting and insurmountable, approach it the right way, it's going to be a piece of cake. 

1. Structure your project as a monolithic microservice repo
2. Make sure it can be cloned and run locally by us
3. Make sure this runs on a machine with ONLY docker and chrome installed

# Tasks

While working on your tasks, please commit and push your code, including WIPs. We want to see your rich interior coding-life, not just one hairball at the end. 

Each task is just a prompt, at the end of the project, as long as you meet the exit critera, what order you approach the project is up to you.

## P-Zeros

1. New Project: A VSCode project, laid out as a monolithic microservice repo
2. Backend: A MongoDB database
3. API: An Express.js based API
